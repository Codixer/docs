This guide is a part of the [NetBird Self-hosting Guide](/getting-started/self-hosting) and explains how to integrate 
**self-hosted** NetBird with [Keycloak](https://www.keycloak.org/).

Keycloak is an open source software product to allow single sign-on with Identity and Access Management aimed at modern applications and services.

:::tip managed idp
If you prefer not to self-host an Identity and Access Management solution, then you could use a managed alternative like
[Auth0](/integrations/identity-providers/self-hosted/using-netbird-with-auth0).
:::

The following guide is an adapted version of the original
[Keycloak on Docker](https://www.keycloak.org/getting-started/getting-started-docker) guide from the official website.

### Expected Result

After completing this guide, you can log in to your self-hosted NetBird Dashboard and add your machines 
to your network using the [Interactive SSO Login feature](/getting-started/installation#running-netbird-with-sso-login) 
over Keycloak.

### Step 1: Check your Keycloak Instance

For this guide, you need a fully configured Keycloak instance running with SSL.

We assume that your Keycloak instance is available at **`https://YOUR-KEYCLOAK-HOST-AND_PORT`**. 
Feel free to change the port if you have configured Keycloak with a different one.

Most of the OIDC software requires SSL for production use. 
We encourage you to comply with this requirement to make the world more secure ðŸ˜Š.

### Step 2: Create a realm

To create a realm you need to:

- Open the Keycloak Admin Console
- Hover the mouse over the dropdown in the top-left corner where it says `Master`, then click on `Create Realm`
- Fill in the form with the following values:
  - Realm name: `netbird`
- Click `Create`
-

### Step 3: Create a user

In this step we will create a NetBird administrator user.

- Open the Keycloak Admin Console
- Make sure, that the selected realm is `Netbird`
- Click `Users` (left-hand menu)
- Click `Create new user`
- Fill in the form with the following values:
  - Username: `netbird`
- Click `Create`

![](/img/integrations/identity-providers/self-hosted/keycloak-create-user.png)

The user will need an initial password set to be able to log in. To do this:
- Click `Credentials` tab
- Click `Set password` button
- Fill in the password form with a password
- Set the `Temporary` field to `Off` to prevent having to update password on first login
- Click `Save`

![](/img/integrations/identity-providers/self-hosted/keycloak-set-password.png)

### Step 4: Create a NetBird client

In this step we will create NetBird application client and register with the Keycloak instance.

- Open the Keycloak Admin Console
- Make sure, that the selected realm is `Netbird`
- Click `Clients`
- Click `Create client` button
- Fill in the form with the following values and click Next:
  - Client Type: `OpenID Connect`
  - Client ID: `netbird-client`
- Your newly client `netbird-client` will be used later to set `NETBIRD_AUTH_CLIENT_ID` in the `setup.env`

![](/img/integrations/identity-providers/self-hosted/keycloak-create-client.png)

- Check the checkboxes as on the screenshot below and click Save

![](/img/integrations/identity-providers/self-hosted/keycloak-enable-auth.png)

### Step 5: Adjust NetBird client access settings

In this step we will configure NetBird application client access with the NetBird URLs.

- Open the Keycloak Admin Console
- Make sure, that the selected realm is `Netbird`
- Click `Clients`
- Choose `netbird-client` from the list
- Go to `Access Settings` section
- Fill in the fields with the following values:
  - Root URL: `https://YOUR DOMAIN/` (this is the NetBird Dashboard root URL)
  - Valid redirect URIs: `https://YOUR DOMAIN/*`
  - Valid post logout redirect URIs: `https://YOUR DOMAIN/*`
  - Web origins: `+`
  - Click `Save`

![](/img/integrations/identity-providers/self-hosted/keycloak-access-settings.png)

### Step 6: Create a NetBird client scope

In this step, we will create and configure the NetBird client audience for Keycloak to add it to the generated JWT tokens.

- Open the Keycloak Admin Console
- Make sure, that the selected realm is `Netbird`
- Click `Client scopes` (left-hand menu)
- Click `Create client scope` button
- Fill in the form with the following values:
  - Name: `api`
  - Type: `Default`
  - Protocol: `OpenID Connect`
- Click `Save`

![](/img/integrations/identity-providers/self-hosted/keycloak-create-client-scope.png)

- While in the newly created Client Scope, switch to the `Mappers` tab
- Click `Configure a new mapper`
- Choose the `Audience` mapping

![](/img/integrations/identity-providers/self-hosted/keycloak-configure-audience-mapper.png)

- Fill in the form with the following values:
  - Name: `Audience for NetBird Management API`
  - Included Client Audience: `netbird-client`
  - Add to access token: `On`
  - Click `Save`

![](/img/integrations/identity-providers/self-hosted/keycloak-configure-audience-mapper-2.png)

### Step 7: Add client scope to NetBird client

- Open the Keycloak Admin Console
- Make sure, that the selected realm is `Netbird`
- Click `Clients`
- Choose `netbird-client` from the list
- Switch to `Client scopes` tab
- Click `Add client scope` button
- Choose `api`
- Click `Add` choosing `Default`
- The value `netbird-client` will be used as audience 

![](/img/integrations/identity-providers/self-hosted/keycloack-add-client-scope.png)

### Step 8: Ensure that all users will join the same NetBird network (Optional)

In this step, we will configure custom JWT claims that will be included in every generated token.
This step is necessary if you want every user created via Keycloak to join the same NetBird network.
Otherwise, every user will have a separate account and network.

- Open the Keycloak Admin Console
- Make sure, that the selected realm is `Netbird`
- Click `Client scopes` (left-hand menu)
- Click `Create client scope` button
- Fill in the form with the following values:
  - Name: `Domain Token Claims`
  - Type: `Default`
  - Protocol: `OpenID Connect`
- Click `Save`

![](/img/integrations/identity-providers/self-hosted/keycloak-domain-token-claim-scope.png)

- While in the newly created Client Scope, switch to the `Mappers` tab
- Click `Configure a new mapper`
- Choose the `Hardcoded claim` mapping

![](/img/integrations/identity-providers/self-hosted/keycloack-domain-token-claim-mapper.png)

- Fill in the form with the following values:
  - Name: `domain`
  - Token Claim Name: `netbird-clientwt_account_domain`. This is not a typo. The name is a concat of `NETBIRD_AUTH_AUDIENCE` and a `wt_account_domain` string
  - Claim value: `<YOUR DOMAIN>`. E.g. `netbird.io`
  - Click `Save`

![](/img/integrations/identity-providers/self-hosted/keycloack-domain-token-claim-mapper-domain.png)

- Repeat the same operation and add a new mapper
- Fill in the form with the following values:
  - Name: `domain_category`
  - Token Claim Name: `netbird-clientwt_account_domain_category`. This is not a typo. The name is a concat of `NETBIRD_AUTH_AUDIENCE` and a `wt_account_domain_category` string
  - Claim value: `private`
  - Click `Save`

![](/img/integrations/identity-providers/self-hosted/keycloack-domain-token-claim-mapper-domain-category.png)

- Open the Keycloak Admin Console
- Make sure, that the selected realm is `Netbird`
- Click `Clients`
- Choose `netbird-client` from the list
- Switch to `Client scopes` tab
- Click `Add client scope` button
- Choose `Domain_Token_Claims`
- CLick `Add` choosing `Default`

![](/img/integrations/identity-providers/self-hosted/keycloack-domain-token-claims-client.png)

### Step 9: Continue with the self-hosting guide

Your authority OIDC configuration will be available under:
```
https://<YOUR-KEYCLOAK-HOST-AND-PORT>/realms/netbird/.well-known/openid-configuration
```
:::caution
Double-check if the endpoint returns a JSON response by calling it from your browser.
:::

- Set properties in the `setup.env` file:
  - NETBIRD_AUTH_OIDC_CONFIGURATION_ENDPOINT=`https://<YOUR-KEYCLOAK-HOST-AND-PORT>/realms/netbird/.well-known/openid-configuration`.
  - NETBIRD_AUTH_CLIENT_ID=`netbird-client`
  - NETBIRD_AUTH_AUDIENCE=`netbird-client`
  - NETBIRD_AUTH_DEVICE_AUTH_CLIENT_ID=`netbird-client`. Optional, 
  it enables the [Interactive SSO Login feature](/getting-started/installation#running-netbird-with-sso-login) (Oauth 2.0 Device Authorization Flow)

- You can now continue with the [NetBird Self-hosting Guide](/getting-started/self-hosting#step-3-configure-identity-provider).

:::note
Make sure that your Keycloak instance use HTTPS. Otherwise, the setup won't work.
