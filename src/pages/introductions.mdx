# NetBird REST API

Use the NetBird Public API to manage users, peers, network rules and more from inside your application or scripts to automate the setup of your mesh network. {{ className: 'lead' }}

<div className="not-prose mb-16 mt-6 flex gap-3">
  <Button href="/quickstart" arrow="right" children="Quickstart" />
  <Button href="/sdks" variant="outline" children="Explore SDKs" />
</div>

## Getting started {{ anchor: false }}

To get started, it is recommended to create a [service user](#), that can later be used to communicate with the NetBird API.
To be able to send requests to our API you need [authenticate](#) on each request. This can be done either by Bearer token from you identity provider or by creating [personal access tokens](#) in the NetBird dashboard.{{ className: 'lead' }}

<div className="not-prose">
  <Button
    href="/sdks"
    variant="text"
    arrow="right"
    children="Get your personal access token"
  />
