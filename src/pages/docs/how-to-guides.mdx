<br/><br/>

NetBird provides fast and reliable end-to-end encryption between peers in your network. You can install the agent on every desktop, VM, container, or physical server and have a fast, secure peer-to-peer mesh network. That is the desired configuration, but some cases do not allow for agent installation or can slow down migration from legacy systems:

- Side-by-side migrations where part of your network is already using NetBird but needs to access services that are not.
- Systems that have limited operating system access. e.g., IoT devices, printers, and managed services.
- Legacy networks where an administrator is unable to install the agent on all nodes.

In these cases, you can configure network routes assigning routing peers to connect existing infrastructure. Routing peers will forward packets between your NetBird peers and your other networks; they can masquerade traffic going to your data centers or embedded devices, reducing the need for external route configuration and agent installation.

<Note>
If you want to see the Network Routes feature in action, try our managed version at https://app.netbird.io/routes.

It's free and simple! :)
</Note>

### Concepts
#### Network routes
A network route describes the network you want to connect with your NetBird peers. It has an identifier, a network range, a routing peer, and some parameters available for managing priority and masquerading.
<Note>
Network routes is available for NetBird [v0.9.0](https://github.com/netbirdio/netbird/releases) or later.
</Note>
#### Network identifiers and ranges
Network identifiers are names for each network you want to route traffic from your peers, and ranges are IP ranges declared in CIDR notation which refers to an external network. The combination of identifiers and these ranges makes a single network.
#### Routing peer
A routing peer is a node that will route packets between your routed network and the other NetBird peers.
<Note>
Only Linux OS nodes can be assigned as routing peers.
</Note>
#### High availability routes
A highly available route is a combination of multiple routes with the same network identifier and ranges. They have different routing peers offering high-available paths for communication between your peers and external networks.
Nodes connected to routing peers will choose one of them to route packets to external networks based on connection type and defined metrics.
#### Masquerade
Masquerade hides other NetBird network IPs behind the routing peer local address when accessing the target Network range. This option allows access to your private networks without configuring routes on your local routers or other devices.

If you don't enable this option, you must configure a route to your NetBird network in your external network infrastructure.
#### Metric and priority
Metric defines prioritization when choosing the main routing peer in a high availability network. Lower metrics have higher priority.

#### Distribution groups
Distribution groups define that peers that belong to groups set in this field will receive the network route.
<Note>
It doesn't remove the need for the routing peer to be connected to these peers
</Note>

### Managing network routes
A network route describes a network you want to connect with your NetBird peers. It has an identifier, a network range, a routing peer, and some parameters available for managing priority and masquerading.

#### Creating a network route
Access the `Network Routes` tab and click the `Add Route` button to create a new route.
That will open a route configuration screen where you can add the information about the network you want to route:
<p align="center">
    <img src="/img/how-to-guides/netbird-network-routes-add-button.png" alt="high-level-dia" style={{boxShadow: '0 4px 8px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2), 0 6px 20px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.19)'}} />
</p>

Now you can enter the details of your route.
In the example below, we are creating a route with the following information:

- Network identifier: `aws-eu-central-1-vpc`
- Description: `Production VPC in Frankfurt`
- Network range: `172.31.0.0/16`
- Routing peer: `aws-nb-europe-router-az-a`
- Distribution Groups: `All`

<p align="center">
    <img src="/img/how-to-guides/netbird-network-routes-create.png" alt="high-level-dia" width="300" style={{boxShadow: '0 4px 8px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2), 0 6px 20px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.19)'}} />
</p>

Once you fill in the route information, you can click on the `Save` button to save your new route.
<p align="center">
    <img src="/img/how-to-guides/netbird-network-routes-saved-new.png" alt="high-level-dia" style={{boxShadow: '0 4px 8px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2), 0 6px 20px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.19)'}} />
</p>
Done! Now every peer connected to your routing peer will be able to send traffic to your external network.

#### Creating highly available routes
To avoid a single point of failure when managing your network, we recommend installing NetBird on every resource.
However, you still want to ensure a reliable connection to your private network when running NetBird on every machine is not feasible.
NetBird Network Routes feature has a High Availability (HA) mode,
allowing one or more NetBird peers to serve as routing peers for the same private network.

To enable high-available mode, you can click on `Configure` and select a new peer in the `Add additional routing peer` field, then select the distribution groups and click on `Save`.

In the following screenshot, we are adding the peer `aws-nb-europe-router-az-b` to the `aws-eu-central-1-vpc` route:

<p align="center">
    <img src="/img/how-to-guides/netbird-network-routes-create-ha.png" alt="high-level-dia" width="300" style={{boxShadow: '0 4px 8px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2), 0 6px 20px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.19)'}} />
</p>

This way, nodes connected to both peer `aws-nb-europe-router-az-a` and peer `aws-nb-europe-router-az-b` would have a highly available connection with the network `172.31.0.0/16`.

<p align="center">
    <img src="/img/how-to-guides/netbird-network-routes-saved-new-ha.png" alt="high-level-dia" style={{boxShadow: '0 4px 8px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2), 0 6px 20px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.19)'}} />
</p>

<Note>
Currently, there is no limitation in the number of routes that form a highly available route. Each connected peer will pick one routing peer to use as the router for a network; this decision is based on metric prioritization and connection attributes like direct or relayed connections.
</Note>

#### Filtering routes distribution with groups
You can select as many distribution groups as you want for your network route. You can update them at the routing peer or high-availability group level. Keep in mind to link them to peers and, if required, to add access control rules ensuring connectivity between these peers and the routing peers of your route
#### Routes without masquerading
If you want more transparency and would like to manage your external network routers, you may choose to disable masquerade for your network routes.
In this case, the routing peer won't hide any NetBird peer  IP and will forward the packets to the target network transparently.

That will require a routing configuration on your external network router pointing your NetBird network back to your routing peer.
This way, devices that don't have the agent installed can communicate with your NetBird peers.

<p align="center">
    <img src="/img/how-to-guides/netbird-network-routes-masquerading.png" alt="high-level-dia" style={{boxShadow: '0 4px 8px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2), 0 6px 20px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.19)'}} />

## Add Users to your network

Whether you have a network for personal use or manage your company's corporate network, you'd probably want to invite
people to your account and join your NetBird network.

There are two ways of adding users to a NetBird account - indirect and direct.

### Indirect user invites
This way of adding users is managed by the NetBird system and doesn't require administrator input.
It works only for organizations with private domains.

Whenever a new user signs up with a private domain (e.g., @netbird.io),
NetBird creates a new account and associates it with the netbird.io organization (domain) automatically. Every consequent user signup with the same @netbird.io domain in their email address will end up under the same organization.

How does it work? Every time a previously unknown user registers at [app.netbird.io](https://app.netbird.io/),
the system classifies the domain part of the email.
The domain can fall into one of the following categories - `public`, `private`, or `unclassified`.
The domains of the private category are the ones that are automatically grouped under the same account.
Public domains are the ones of the public email providers like Gmail.

<Note>
It might happen (unlikely) that the domain classification system didn't classify your company's domain as private.
Our system was unsure about your domain and assigned an unclassified or public category to be on the safe side.
Just email us at [hello@netbird.io](mailto:hello@netbird.io) or ping us on [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/netbirdio/shared_invite/zt-vrahf41g-ik1v7fV8du6t0RwxSrJ96A) to fix this.
</Note>

### Direct user invites
As the name stands, this way of inviting users is straightforward and works through the web UI.
To invite a new user, proceed to the `Users` tab and click the <button name="button" className="button-6">Invite User</button> button.
A user window will pop up where you can specify the name and email address of the invited user. Optionally, you could select a set of groups with which you want this user to be associated.

The invited users will receive an email invitation that they have to confirm.
After logging in to the system, they will join your network automatically.

<p align="center">
    <img src="/img/how-to-guides/user-invites.gif" alt="high-level-dia" width="800" style={{boxShadow: '0 4px 8px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2), 0 6px 20px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.19)'}} />
</p>

<Note>
If a user already has a NetBird account, you can't invite them.
This is a limitation that is likely to be removed in future versions.

## Manage DNS in your network

<div class="videowrapper">
    <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xxQ_QeEMC0U" allow="fullscreen;"></iframe>
</div>
<br/><br/>

You don't need to design a network or configure [DHCP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_Host_Configuration_Protocol)
as it is automatically done in a single place - the NetBird Management service.
NetBird assigns and automatically distributes IP addresses to your peers.
Once peers have IPs, they can communicate with one another and establish direct encrypted WireGuard® tunnels.
You can use these IPs to access the services running on the connected peers (e.g., SSH).
Even though we trust our memory capacity, there is a limit to what we can remember,
especially when it comes to IP addresses like this one, 100.128.185.34.

Starting [v0.11.0](https://github.com/netbirdio/netbird/releases), NetBird automatically assigns a domain name
to each peer in a private `netbird.cloud` space that can be used to access the machines. E.g., `my-server.netbird.cloud`.

Besides accessing machines by their domain names, you can configure NetBird to use your private nameservers,
control what nameservers a specific [peer group](https://netbird.io/docs/overview/acls#groups) should use, and set up split DNS.

<Note>
Nameservers is available for NetBird [v0.11.0](https://github.com/netbirdio/netbird/releases) or later.
</Note>

### Concepts
#### Local resolver
To minimize the number of changes in your system, NetBird will spin up a local DNS resolver.

This local resolver will be responsible for queries to the domain names of peers registered in your network and forwarding queries to upstream nameservers you configure in the system.

It listens on the peer's IP, and usually, it will use the default port 53, but if it is in use, it will use the 5053 port.
<Note>
Custom port support is not builtin into most operating systems. At the time of release, the supported systems are:
- MacOS
- Linux with systemd-resolved
</Note>
#### Nameserver
Nameserver is an upstream DNS server for name resolution, if a query comes and is not a peer domain name, it will be resolved by one of the upstream servers. You can assign private and public IPs and custom ports. Remember that you might need a network route for private addresses to allow peers to connect to it.
#### Match domains
Match domains allow you to route queries of names, matching them to specific nameservers. This is useful when you have an internal DNS configuration that only internal servers can resolve.
#### All domains option
The all domains option defines a default nameserver configuration to resolve all domains that don't have a match domain setting. Because not all operating systems support match domain configuration, we recommend configuring at least one nameserver set with this option enabled per distribution group. You may also consider using the group All for distribution, so you don't have to define multiple sets of nameservers to resolve all domains.
<Note>
A nameserver set may only be configured with either All domains or match domains, you can have both settings in a single configuration as they overlap.
</Note>
#### Distribution groups
Distribution defines that peers that belong to groups set in this field will receive the nameserver configuration.
<Note>
When using private nameservers, you may use these groups to link routing peers and clients of the private servers.
</Note>

### Managing nameserver groups
A nameserver group defines up to 2 nameservers to resolve DNS to a set of peers in distribution groups.

#### Creating a nameserver group
Access the `DNS` tab and click the `Add Nameserver` button to create a new nameserver.
<p align="center">
    <img src="/img/how-to-guides/netbird-nameserver-add-button.png" alt="high-level-dia" style={{boxShadow: '0 4px 8px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2), 0 6px 20px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.19)'}} />
</p>
That will open a nameserver selection configuration screen where you can choose between using three predefined public
nameservers or using a custom setup.

##### Selecting predefined nameservers
If you choose a predefined public nameserver option, you can select the following nameservers:
- [Google DNS servers](https://developers.google.com/speed/public-dns/docs/using)
- [Cloudflare DNS servers](https://one.one.one.one/dns/)
- [Quad9 DNS servers](https://www.quad9.net/)
<p align="center">
    <img src="/img/how-to-guides/netbird-nameserver-selection-view-open.png" alt="high-level-dia" width="300" style={{boxShadow: '0 4px 8px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2), 0 6px 20px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.19)'}} />
</p>

After selecting one of the three options, you need to assign a peer group for which this nameserver will be effective.
In the example below, we chose the "All" group:
<p align="center">
    <img src="/img/how-to-guides/netbird-nameserver-all-group.png" alt="high-level-dia" width="300" style={{boxShadow: '0 4px 8px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2), 0 6px 20px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.19)'}} />
</p>

##### Creating custom nameservers
You can also configure a custom nameserver by clicking the `Add custom` button. Now you can enter the details of your nameserver.

In the example below, we are creating a nameserver with the following information:

- Name: `Office resolver`
- Description: `Berlin office resolver`
- Add at least one nameserver: `192.168.0.32` with port `53`
- Match mode: `All domains`
- Distribution group: `Remote developers`
<p align="center">
    <img src="/img/how-to-guides/netbird-nameserver-custom.png" alt="high-level-dia" width="300" style={{boxShadow: '0 4px 8px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2), 0 6px 20px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.19)'}} />
</p>

#### Creating a nameserver for specific domains
Sometimes we want to forward DNS queries to specific nameservers but only for particular domains that match a setting.
Taking the example of custom nameservers above, you could select a match mode for only domains listed there.
Below you can see the same nameserver setup but only for the `berlinoffice.com` domain:
<p align="center">
    <img src="/img/how-to-guides/netbird-nameserver-remote-resolver.png" alt="high-level-dia" width="300" style={{boxShadow: '0 4px 8px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2), 0 6px 20px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.19)'}} />
</p>

<Note>
Currently, only MacOS, Windows 10+, and Linux running systemd-resolved support nameservers without an all domains resolver. For a better experience, we recommend setting at least one all domain resolver to be applied to all groups.
</Note>

#### Distributing the settings with groups
You can select as many distribution groups as you want for your nameserver setup. Keep in mind to link them to peers and, if required, to add access control rules when using private nameservers.
#### Adding remote private DNS servers
To add a private DNS server that is running behind routing peers, you need to create resources to ensure communication between your nameserver clients can communicate. In the Berlin office example from previous steps, we have a peer from the `Office network` that can route traffic to the `192.168.0.32` IP, so we need to ensure that a similar network route exists:
<p align="center">
    <img src="/img/how-to-guides/netbird-nameserver-remote-route.png" alt="high-level-dia" style={{boxShadow: '0 4px 8px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2), 0 6px 20px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.19)'}} />
</p>

Then we need to confirm that an access rule exists to connect `Remote developers` to `Office network` group:
<p align="center">
    <img src="/img/how-to-guides/netbird-nameserver-remote-rule.png" alt="high-level-dia" style={{boxShadow: '0 4px 8px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2), 0 6px 20px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.19)'}} />
</p>

### Testing configuration
#### Querying records
DNS configuration has evolved in the last few years, and each operating system might expose its nameserver configuration differently. Unfortunately, tools like `nslookup` or `dig` didn't get updated to match these OS configurations, and in many cases, they won't use the same servers as your browser to query domain names.

For these cases, we listed some tools to support your checks:
##### MacOS
You can use `dscacheutil`:
```shell
dscacheutil -q host -a name peer-a.netbird.cloud
```
##### Windows
You can use `Resolve-DnsName` on `Powershell`:
```shell
Resolve-DnsName -Name  peer-a.netbird.cloud
```
##### Linux
In most cases, you will be fine with traditional tools because most DNS managers on Linux tend to update the /etc/resolv.conf.
```shell
dig peer-a.netbird.cloud
# or
nslookup peer-a.netbird.cloud
```
If your system is running systemd-resolved, you can also use ```resolvectl```:
```shell
resolvectl query peer-a.netbird.cloud
```

## Monitor system and network activity

The activity monitoring feature lets you quickly see what's happening with your network.
Whether a new machine or user joined your network or the access control policy has been modified, the activity log allows you to track the changes to your network.

Activity monitoring is enabled by default for every network, and you can access it in the web UI under the [Activity tab](https://app.netbird.io/activity).
You can also use the search bar to filter events by activity type.

<p align="center">
    <img src="/img/how-to-guides/activity-monitoring.png" alt="activity-monitoring" width="800" style={{boxShadow: '0 4px 8px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2), 0 6px 20px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.19)'}} />
</p>

<Note>
The current version of NetBird tracks network changes that occur in the Management server. E.g., changes related to the list of peers, groups, system settings, setup keys, access control, etc.
The future versions will support connection events that occur in NetBird agents (e.g., peer A connected to peer B).

## Configure periodic user authentication

To ensure a high level of security, NetBird offers a peer login expiration feature that requires users to periodically reauthenticate their devices.
Every new network has this feature enabled, and the expiration period is set to 24 hours by default. You can disable this feature and configure the expiration period in the account settings in the web UI https://app.netbird.io/settings.

<Note>
This feature is only applied to peers added with the [interactive SSO login feature](/getting-started/installation#running-netbird-with-sso-login). Peers, added with a setup key, won't be affected.
</Note>

Expired peers will appear in the peers' view with the status `needs login`.

<p align="center">
    <img src="/img/how-to-guides/peer-needs-login.png" alt="peer-needs-login.png" style={{boxShadow: '0 4px 8px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2), 0 6px 20px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.19)'}} />
</p>

### Configure and disable expiration
The expiration period can be set to anything between one hour and 180 days.
Go to the Web UI Settings tab and set the desired period in the Authentication section.
You can also disable the expiration for the whole network in the same section.

<p align="center">
    <img src="/img/how-to-guides/peer-login-expiration.png" alt="peer-login-expiration" style={{boxShadow: '0 4px 8px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2), 0 6px 20px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.19)'}} />
</p>


<Note>
Enabling peer expiration or changing the expiration period will cause some peers added with the SSO login to disconnect,
and re-authentication will be required.
</Note>

### Disable expiration individually per peer
Sometimes, you might want to disable peer expiration for some peers.
With NetBird you can disable login expiration per peer without disabling expiration globally.
In the Peers tab of the web UI click on the peer you want to disable expiration for and use the Login Expiration switch.
Peers with `expiration disabled` will be marked with a corresponding label in the peers' table.

<p align="center">
    <img src="/img/how-to-guides/individual-peer-login-expiration.png" alt="peer-login-expiration" style={{boxShadow: '0 4px 8px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2), 0 6px 20px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.19)'}} />
