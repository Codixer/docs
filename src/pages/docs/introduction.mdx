# Introduction

NetBird is a simple and fast alternative to corporate VPNs built on top of [WireGuard®](https://www.wireguard.com/) making it easy to create secure private networks for your organization or home.

NetBird can connect machines running anywhere in just a few clicks.

It requires near zero configuration effort leaving behind the hassle of opening ports, complex firewall rules, vpn gateways, and so forth.

:::tip open-source
NetBird is an **open-source** project.

Check it out on GitHub: **[https://github.com/netbirdio/netbird](https://github.com/netbirdio/netbird)**
:::

There is no centralized VPN server with NetBird - your computers, devices, machines, and servers connect to each other directly over a fast encrypted tunnel.

It literally takes less than 5 minutes to deploy a secure peer-to-peer VPN with NetBird. Check our [Quick Start Guide](/getting-started/quickstart) to get started.
