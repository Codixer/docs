# NetBird REST API

Use the NetBird Public API to manage users, peers, network rules and more from inside your application or scripts to automate the setup of your mesh network. {{ className: 'lead' }}

## Getting started {{ anchor: false }}

To get started, it is recommended to create a [service user](/docs/how-to/use-service-users-with-access-token#service-users), that can later be used to communicate with the NetBird API.
To be able to send requests to our API you need to [authenticate](/ipa/guides/authentication) on each request. This can be done either by Bearer token from your identity provider or by creating a [personal access token](/docs/how-to/use-service-users-with-access-token#personal-access-tokens) in the NetBird dashboard.{{ className: 'lead' }}

<div className="not-prose">
  <Button
    href="/docs/how-netbird-works#personal-access-tokens"
    variant="text"
    arrow="right"
    children="Get your personal access token"
  />
</div>
